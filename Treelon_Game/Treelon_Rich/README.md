# Treelon_Rich

Treelon_Rich is the rich text terminal based Treelon game. It is being produced as a single day game jam challenge. Treelon_Rich will evolve into a more sophisitcated gate in 3d using OpenGL, but for now, it is just rich text using Python's [rich library](https://github.com/Textualize/rich)
