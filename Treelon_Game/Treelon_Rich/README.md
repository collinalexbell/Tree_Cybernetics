# Treelon_Rich

Treelon_Rich is the rich text terminal based Treelon game. It is being produced as a single day game jam challenge. Treelon_Rich will evolve into a more sophisitcated game in 3d using OpenGL, but for now, it is just rich text using Python's [rich library](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) 

## The Plot

The plot of Treelon_Rich is designed specifically to aid in showcasing several planned features of Treelon

The game takes place in Manhattan, NYC. The player commutes between a few neighborhoods in NYC to attend business meetings, experience the night life, pursue his soul mate, and relax into deep work focus at some of the best spots in New York.

## The Mechanics for this Prototype
